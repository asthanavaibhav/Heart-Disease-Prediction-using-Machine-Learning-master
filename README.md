# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-master
Heart Disease prediction using machine Learning. In this project, I am used multiple algorithms, but random forest gives better result.  
Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
